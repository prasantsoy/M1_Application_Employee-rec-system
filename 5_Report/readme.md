## It contains the overall review of the project

## Introduction
    Employee Record System is software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a company. 
    ERS helps companies keep track of all the employees and their records. 
    It is used to manage the company using a computerized system. 
    This software built to handle the records of employees of any company. 
    It will help companies to keep track of all the employeesâ€™ records in a file. 

## Defining Our System
    The user will be provided with 5 options:
    1.Add a new record.
    2.Delete a record.
    3.Modify a record.
    4.View all the records.
    5.Exit.
    
    Data of the Employees:
    1.Name
    2.Age
    3.Salary
    4.Employee ID
    
    All the functions will be provided under switch cases. 
    The idea is to use the concepts of File Handling to write the data in a text file and read the written data as well. 
    We need to add a data.txt file in the same folder as well.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
